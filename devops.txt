Devops : 
devops = development + Operations
It's a culture + Set of practices + tools that help:
* developers : (who writes code )
* Operations : (who deploy/manage systems)
Works together instead of working silos
It Autobuilds ,auto tests , auto deploys the code without much human intervention.

REAL-TIME EXAMPLE :

Imagine you are building a mobile app like swiggy .
⦁	the developer writes code to add "Track my order " feature .
⦁	Without devops: Developer gives code to Ops team--> they manually deploy--> bugs happen --> delays.
⦁	with devOps : Code is automatically tested and deployed -->customers get updates faster and safely.
DevOps Helps you :
⦁	Release features faster (like adding new payment method in Zomato)
⦁	Fix bugs quickly (like fixing login issues)
⦁	Automate repetitive tasks
